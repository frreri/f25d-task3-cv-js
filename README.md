# F25D Task 3


Live Preview (Github-pages): [Click here!](https://frreri.github.io/f25d-task3-cv-js/)


This is a continuation of the resume page I made as the second task in my Frontend Development class.
This time I have added javascript to make the page more interactive and dynamic. 

- The resume is now built from a JSON-data file instead of being hardcoded. 
- I have now changed so that the entire site is one page and the navigation bar is now smoothly scrolling to the sections
- When you scroll down a bit, the navigation bar becomes sticky so that you can still easily navigate
- Sections are now revealed as you scroll to them by fading in and moving upwards
- There is now a slider that dynamically displays all my public github projects
- I have also optimized pictures used to be in the webp format so there is less data to download


The site gets full score in Google Chromes builtin Lighthouse:

###### The HTML validates with no errors or warnings at validator.w3.org (there are some info messages regarding the traling slash /> on self closing tags that Prettier adds that i found annoying, but i learned that it isn't a problem and just info in case they were used for the wrong reason. Even code examples at MDN web docs use the trailing slashes and Prettier as formatter)
